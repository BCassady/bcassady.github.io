									<h3 class="major">Background</h3>
									<p>I grew up in Springdale, Arkansas where I lived with both of my parents and three brothers. For high school, attended the Don Tyson School of Innovation. In high school, I found a passion for all areas of STEM, especially computer science and robotics. Most of this passion came from competitive robotics, where I was a part of FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) team 9879 Root Negative One. My high school robotics career was very successful as in 2019 I won the FTC Dean's List Award and our team won the FTC Houston World Championship.</p>

									<br clear="all">
									<p>My extra-curricular activities have continued throughout college. I am currently a Co-President of FIRST at Rice a club that mentors and serves underprivileged and underrepresented teams in the Houston area. As Co-President I am in charge of planning and managing events, leading programming workshops, designing course material, and managing club funds. Additionally, I am a part of the Rice Computer Science club, where I participate in many computer science events. Most recently, my team won the Google Cloud Award at HackRice 11 for our app edYou. </p>

									<p>In my free time I like to play video games, hangout with freinds, eat good food, and recently, play racquetball in Rice's intramural racquetball league. </p>
